# Crystal structure phase mapping code and data

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- TensorFlow 1.8
- skimage
- scikit-learn

## Description

Additional details are in the readme.md in the subdirectory for each experiment: 

- **./Al-Li-Fe-lib-159-I-compressed-new-231-solu/** : the code for the Al-Li-Fe oxide system
- **./Bi-Cu-V-lib-100-I-compressed-new-307--solu/** : the code for the Bi-Cu-V oxide system
- **./data/** : data files for the three systems, preprocessed for use with DRNets
- **./Li-Sr-Al-powder-lib-38-50--fullQ-solu/** : the folder for the Li-Sr-Al powder system
- **./solutions/** : the raw files containing input XRD patterns and the solutions for each system

You can view the instances and their corresponding solutions at http://18.205.162.82/ . Load the instance file (xxx_inst_XXX.txt), followed by the solution file (xxx_sol_xxx.txt) using the panel on the left side of the screen.
