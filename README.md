# Deep Reasoning Networks (DRNets)

DRNets provide a general framework for integrating pattern recognition capabilities with reasoning about prior knowledge. The result is an end-to-end framework that can solve a broad range of mixed reasoning and learning problems. At a high level, DRNets combine deep learning with constraint reasoning by formulating a task as a data-driven constrained optimization problem, which is then reduced through a sequence of transformations into a data-driven unconstrained optimization problem amenable to end-to-end optimization via state-of-the-art deep learning technology.

## Citation

This work accompanies the following publication:

- Di Chen, Yiwei Bai, Sebastian Ament, Wenting Zhao, Dan Guevarra, Lan Zhou, Bart Selman, R. Bruce van Dover, John M. Gregoire, Carla P. Gomes. Automating Crystal-Structure Phase Mapping by Combining Deep Learning with Constraint Reasoning *Nature Machine Intelligence*, in review (2021).

## Directory structure

There is a top-level directory for each of the three example applications:

- **Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping** : Crystal structure phase mapping for two chemical systems: (1) a ternary Al-Li-Fe oxide system, which is theoretically-based, synthetically generated, with ground-truth solutions, and (2) a ternary Bi-Cu-V oxide system, which is a more challenging real system obtained from chemical experiments and is more noisy and uncertain. For each system, the input data points are mixtures of XRD patterns, associated with a composition graph identifying elemental compositions, and a constraint graph of data points, in which there is an edge between two data points if they share a constraint. 
For comparison with a recent simulation-based algorithm, we also analysed a powder system (Li-Sr-Al) from the article "A deep-learning technique for phase identification in multiphase inorganic compounds using synthetic XRD powder patterns".

- **Games** : Two illustrative games: Multi-MNIST-Sudoku (4x4 and 9x9)

These directories contain the relevant code and data, except the eBird data for joint species distribution modeling, which is provided separately due to large file sizes.



## Hardware Requirements

The code is mainly in Python using PyTorch or TensorFlow which is recommended to be run on a computer with GPUs (Otherwise, it takes too long to run it). 
For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 32+ GB  
CPU: 8+ cores, 3.0+ GHz/core
GPU: NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 16GB memory

The runtimes in the paper are generated using a computer with the recommended specs.

## Software Requirements

### OS Requirements

The code is tested on *Linux* operating systems. The developmental version of the package has been tested on the following systems:

Linux: Centos 7.8

### Dependency Requirements

The code is mainly in Python using PyTorch or TensorFlow. Dependencies that satisfy all applications include:

- Python 3.7
- PyTorch 0.4.1
- TensorFlow 1.8
- Torchvision 0.4.0
- Scikit-image
- Scikit-learn 0.19.2

(It takes less than 30 minutes to install these packages.)

Helper scripts also assume a Bourne or Bash shell, however they are short and can easily be converted to other platforms or entered manually.
